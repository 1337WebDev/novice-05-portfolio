# Instructions

Greetings, developer!

As you wrap up your latest project as a novice, your journey as a beginner will draw to a close.
Throughout your journey, you have constructed a plethora of impressive projects, which have equipped you with the skills and expertise necessary to create your own portfolio.

Your portfolio, while temporary, will serve as a showcase for your projects and abilities.
Crafting it will require a spark of imagination, as you will not be receiving any guidance from us during the process. However, we will furnish you with a design sample, and you are welcome to create something akin to it.

Bear in mind that upon completing this project, you will no longer be a novice, but rather a Rookie Web Developer.
Following a brief hiatus, you will embark upon a new journey.

## Follow these instructions to have the best experience:

### 1 - Setting up the GitHub Repo:

To begin working on your own repository, the first step is to remove the .git folder `rm -rf .git`.
Then, create a new repository on GitHub and initialize it by running the command `git init` in your local project directory.
Add all files to the staging area using `git add .` and create your first commit with `git commit -m 'My first commit'`.
After completing these steps, you can add the remote origin to your repository by running `git remote add origin 'link of your repository'`.
Finally, push your first commit to the remote origin with `git push origin master`.

### 2 - Working on the project:

This project has no assets, you'll have to bring your own assets!
